// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
*/
var planning = "sets the project schedule, plans the upcoming project,it helps to define the problem and scope of any existing systems, as well as determine the objectives for their new systems"
var analysisOfRequirements = "all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expecttions, any ambiguities must be resolved in this phase only"
var design ="the requirement gathered in the SRS document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for implementing system development is derived"
var implementation = "implementation /coding starts once the developer gets the design doc. the software design is translated into sourcd code, all the components of the software are implemented in this phase"
var testingAndIntegration = "the developed software is tested thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to develpers to get them fixed"
var maintain = "maintenance of the product if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers"
